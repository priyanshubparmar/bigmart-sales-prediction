Subject: Case Study â€“ BigMart Sales Prediction (Repo + Data + Starter Notebook)

Dear DPR Sir,

As discussed, I have prepared a GitHub repository for the **BigMart Sales Prediction** case study. It includes:
- README with problem statement, data dictionary, objective and evaluation
- Starter notebook for EDA + baseline model
- Standard folder structure for students
- Placeholders for train/test/sample_submission files in data/raw/

Repo: <REPO_URL>
Original dataset: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/datahack/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/

Students can clone the repo, follow the README, and submit their solutions. We can rank entries by RMSE and invite top performers to present briefly.

Warm regards,
Vijay
